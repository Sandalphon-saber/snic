description: behavioral model of synstor-but because lack data,the formula and parameters are set arbitrarily
timing_sensitivity: 
parameters:  double w0, double w_max,double w_min
inputs:  double in, double fedback

init:

code:  
//Due to the lack of data, we only gave an inaccurate model based on the device behavior, which needs to be improved later
